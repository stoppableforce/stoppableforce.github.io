        <p>Boy, I had a pretty good blogging streak going there for a while! Well, at least I&rsquo;m not gonna let a whole month go by without putting something here. Heh.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had a lot going on in March in terms of the usual things that I blog about: no completed video games to wax poetic about, no big projects like the <a href="/2025-02-20.md">great De-Googling</a>, nothing like that. Bullet point time:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been going back and forth between two different ideas for game development projects, trying to decide which one I&rsquo;d rather do first; I think I finally settled on one and am doing a good amount of worldbuilding as well as some low-level actual code writing. The other is on the back burner waiting to become more fully baked for the time being.</li>
<li>The Traveller 2e game that replaced my (now-wrapped-up) D&amp;D 5e game finally started. I am currently playing former noble and current lawyer Fontaine Infinity, who has no combat skills to speak of but is surprisingly good at giving orders in combat as well as, well, lawyering. (He made it out of character creation with 4 ranks in the Advocate skill and a smattering of other face skills, but &ndash; surprisingly &ndash; none in Deception.)</li>
<li>World of Warcraft&rsquo;s second major raid of the current expansion dropped, and so my raid team is back to raiding twice a week. We&rsquo;ve made pretty astounding progress, clearing the entire thing in normal in one week and then trouncing 3 out of 8 heroic bosses very quickly, with a 4th likely to go down on Monday night when we raid again. Here&rsquo;s a kill shot of us gathered around the most recent to fall, Rik Reverb:<br>
<img src="/ob/posts/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250328135519.png" alt="Screenshot from World of Warcraft of TTGF&rsquo;s heroic raid team gathered around a defeated Rik Reverb, one of the bosses in The Liberation of Undermine raid"></li>
<li>The third of three episodes of an actual play I ran for <a href="https://blizzardwatch.com/podcast/#tavernwatchpodcast">The Tavern Watch Podcast</a>, playing <a href="https://hauntedtable.games">Triangle Agency</a>, is up now. I thought it was a lot of fun, although trying to keep the spotlight going for six people can be a real task. I also thought on reading the adventure as written &ndash; it&rsquo;s a pre-written one from The Vault, a book of premade mysteries that came with the Triangle Agency core book &ndash; that it&rsquo;s not, uh, a very good mystery. As written, <em>Dead Quiet</em> presented a whole list of locations for players to go to, but they were so saturated in clues that led directly to the end of the mystery that there was not really a reason to visit more than one. (Essentially they only even went to two because the second one had an easy way to rack up 10 Commendations from the company.) A lot of the contents of The Vault are like that, so if I run TA again, I&rsquo;m definitely going to be trying to write something of my own.</li>
<li>I have another actual play next month for the same podcast in which I&rsquo;ll be running <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonofoak/legend-in-the-mist-rpg">Legend in the Mist</a>&rsquo;s playtest materials. Should be fun; expect that to be out sometime in May, most likely.</li>
<li>Also my actual job has just been kind of going at breakneck speed? I&rsquo;ve been pulled back and forth between two major projects, with a third looming in the wings to occupy any downtime I might have, which &ndash; well, look at the timestamps on previous posts, and maybe the explanation for why my post count in March is 1 might make sense. Heh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway: all that to say I am alive and well and keeping myself busy. Maybe I should do some devlog posts here once that game project starts being interesting to look at? Not sure if it&rsquo;ll be here or somewhere else, but given how much I&rsquo;ve enjoyed keeping everything sequested in Obsidian, it might just be here in a subfolder. Something to look forward to.</p>

        <p>Over the course of the last year, I have slowly been taking steps to pull myself out of actively using the Google ecosystem. It&rsquo;s hard sometimes &ndash; they feel almost ubiquitous &ndash; but when Gemini came around and it became clear that active enshittification was the name of the game for the big G, I had to start finding ways to get free.</p>
<p>The other inspiration was just what a fucking miserable experience searching the web had become. So my first de-googlefication was stopping use of Google, and starting to instead use <a href="https://kagi.com/">Kagi</a>. This has been a delightful experience, and I&rsquo;ve talked a number of folks into coming along with me (enough that I have a family plan!), as changing your browser to search somewhere else is fairly low effort.</p>

<p>Sometimes you play a game, and maybe that game is fun for a while, but when you&rsquo;re done, nothing really sticks with you. You bring nothing to the table, you take nothing away, and you&rsquo;re finished with it, done and dusted. I find this to be a pretty common experience with AAA games these days, to be honest.</p>

        <h2 id="diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</h2>
<p>Back in <a href="/2025-01-19.md">my post about Transistor</a> I mentioned that the second game I finished in 2025 was probably going to be Helen&rsquo;s Mysterious Castle; instead, it turned out to be Diablo 4&rsquo;s expansion pack, Vessel of Hatred. It was&hellip; okay.</p>
<p>First, about Diablo 4 as a game: it&rsquo;s actually really good, although it took some time to get there. The Diablo 4 team seemed entirely determined to learn absolutely nothing from the Diablo 3 team&rsquo;s mistakes and recoveries early on, and honestly that&rsquo;s still kind of a recurring theme across Blizzard as a whole (I suspect inter-team communication basically doesn&rsquo;t exist), but Diablo 4 got really good &ndash; the game is fun to play, the classes are varied and have a lot of viable endgame builds for what is now a large variety of endgame content, it&rsquo;s really everything you could want out of an action RPG. The seasonal content is hit or miss, but the current Season of the Witch is probably my favorite since the Season of Blood&rsquo;s vampire-based content back in Season 2. So my comments on Vessel of Hatred do not reflect on how fun the game itself actually is to play.</p>

<p>I decided at some point (probably after surveying <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/stoppableforce">my enormous Steam backlog</a>) that I was going to start keeping track of games when I finish them, so that I remember to talk about them. Anyway, the first game of the year finished in 2025 was Supergiant Games&rsquo; <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/">Transistor</a>. I actually own Transistor twice; once on the PS3, which I bought, and once on Steam, where my friend Maxine was kind enough to gift it to me for Christmas and thus remind me that I never really got too far into it. On the PS3, I both found the text size on screen infuriatingly small, and also found the combat system just <em>way</em> too hard for some reason, so I abandoned it not far into the game &ndash; which is a problem, because there is such a good game under the surface here.</p>

        <p>This past weekend was one of my favorite recurring events, now going on three years in a row: several of my college friends and I rent out an AirBNB and spend the weekend making food together, eating, drinking, and playing card, board and video games. It&rsquo;s just like a weekend-long taste of dorm life again, except we&rsquo;ve all moved from takeout to chili cookoffs and cheap beer to a bar full of nice bourbons and whiskeys. It&rsquo;s always a good time catching up with people; as a bonus this time we managed to get a couple of folks we hadn&rsquo;t talked with in maybe 17 years to join us as well. It felt just like old times again. We&rsquo;re all the same, just older and greyer.</p>

        <p>New year, new really nerdy way to apply Obsidian. Ever since I bought <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1148760/I_Was_a_Teenage_Exocolonist/">I Was a Teenage Exocolonist</a> in November I&rsquo;ve been really obsessed with exploring every little corner of this beautiful little narrative deckbuilding RPG. I recently decided I wanted to get 100% completion of the game, but doing that requires two things that take some extensive tracking: getting every ending at least once (there are 29), and getting every card at least once (there are&hellip;. tons). Obviously I can just make checklists in Obsidian, but then I figured out I could use <a href="https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/">Dataview</a> to query over those files as well, and show myself a nice table of my progress.</p>
