      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend was one of my favorite recurring events, now going on three years in a row: several of my college friends and I rent out an AirBNB and spend the weekend making food together, eating, drinking, and playing card, board and video games. It&amp;rsquo;s just like a weekend-long taste of dorm life again, except we&amp;rsquo;ve all moved from takeout to chili cookoffs and cheap beer to a bar full of nice bourbons and whiskeys. It&amp;rsquo;s always a good time catching up with people; as a bonus this time we managed to get a couple of folks we hadn&amp;rsquo;t talked with in maybe 17 years to join us as well. It felt just like old times again. We&amp;rsquo;re all the same, just older and greyer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
