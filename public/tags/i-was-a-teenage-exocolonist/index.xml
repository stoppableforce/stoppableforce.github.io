      <description>&lt;p&gt;New year, new really nerdy way to apply Obsidian. Ever since I bought &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1148760/I_Was_a_Teenage_Exocolonist/&#34;&gt;I Was a Teenage Exocolonist&lt;/a&gt; in November I&amp;rsquo;ve been really obsessed with exploring every little corner of this beautiful little narrative deckbuilding RPG. I recently decided I wanted to get 100% completion of the game, but doing that requires two things that take some extensive tracking: getting every ending at least once (there are 29), and getting every card at least once (there are&amp;hellip;. tons). Obviously I can just make checklists in Obsidian, but then I figured out I could use &lt;a href=&#34;https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/&#34;&gt;Dataview&lt;/a&gt; to query over those files as well, and show myself a nice table of my progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
