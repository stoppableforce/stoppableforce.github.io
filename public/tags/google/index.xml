      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the last year, I have slowly been taking steps to pull myself out of actively using the Google ecosystem. It&amp;rsquo;s hard sometimes &amp;ndash; they feel almost ubiquitous &amp;ndash; but when Gemini came around and it became clear that active enshittification was the name of the game for the big G, I had to start finding ways to get free.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other inspiration was just what a fucking miserable experience searching the web had become. So my first de-googlefication was stopping use of Google, and starting to instead use &lt;a href=&#34;https://kagi.com/&#34;&gt;Kagi&lt;/a&gt;. This has been a delightful experience, and I&amp;rsquo;ve talked a number of folks into coming along with me (enough that I have a family plan!), as changing your browser to search somewhere else is fairly low effort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
