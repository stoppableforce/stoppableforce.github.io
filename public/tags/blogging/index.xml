      <title>Hypothetically, Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hypothetically, if I did everything correctly, this site should now be running off &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. I was never &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; happy with the way Quartz required me to maintain my own front page, since it really wants to throw your entire vault onto a website instead of just a subset of it, which required me to do wonky stuff with symlinks and directory junctions and&amp;hellip; anyway, after &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.awaymessage.club/2025-06-12.md&#34;&gt;I broke my own Quartz install&lt;/a&gt; a few days ago, I decided to just say fuck it, let&amp;rsquo;s try something else. Now I&amp;rsquo;ve got an Obsidian vault with a specific subfolder that, thanks to a community plugin, I can spit into a Hugo install whenever I like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Clearly not out of my way enough</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Clearly a blogging system that got mostly out of my way so I could focus on blogging wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite good enough. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite help that I broke my setup with Windows for a bit &amp;ndash; the newest version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/&#34;&gt;Quartz&lt;/a&gt; requires a newer version of Node.js than we were using for work, so I ended up switching back to using &lt;a href=&#34;https://zone-builder.neocities.org&#34;&gt;Zoner&lt;/a&gt;, which has been a trip. That also means actual new posts aren&amp;rsquo;t getting posted for a bit because I&amp;rsquo;m not just reinventing the wheel, I&amp;rsquo;m finding entirely new ways to reinvent the reinventing machine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A busy March</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Boy, I had a pretty good blogging streak going there for a while! Well, at least I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna let a whole month go by without putting something here. Heh.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a lot going on in March in terms of the usual things that I blog about: no completed video games to wax poetic about, no big projects like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.awaymessage.club/2025-02-20.md&#34;&gt;great De-Googling&lt;/a&gt;, nothing like that. Bullet point time:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been going back and forth between two different ideas for game development projects, trying to decide which one I&amp;rsquo;d rather do first; I think I finally settled on one and am doing a good amount of worldbuilding as well as some low-level actual code writing. The other is on the back burner waiting to become more fully baked for the time being.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Traveller 2e game that replaced my (now-wrapped-up) D&amp;amp;D 5e game finally started. I am currently playing former noble and current lawyer Fontaine Infinity, who has no combat skills to speak of but is surprisingly good at giving orders in combat as well as, well, lawyering. (He made it out of character creation with 4 ranks in the Advocate skill and a smattering of other face skills, but &amp;ndash; surprisingly &amp;ndash; none in Deception.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;World of Warcraft&amp;rsquo;s second major raid of the current expansion dropped, and so my raid team is back to raiding twice a week. We&amp;rsquo;ve made pretty astounding progress, clearing the entire thing in normal in one week and then trouncing 3 out of 8 heroic bosses very quickly, with a 4th likely to go down on Monday night when we raid again. Here&amp;rsquo;s a kill shot of us gathered around the most recent to fall, Rik Reverb:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://notes.awaymessage.club/ob/posts/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250328135519.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot from World of Warcraft of TTGF&amp;rsquo;s heroic raid team gathered around a defeated Rik Reverb, one of the bosses in The Liberation of Undermine raid&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The third of three episodes of an actual play I ran for &lt;a href=&#34;https://blizzardwatch.com/podcast/#tavernwatchpodcast&#34;&gt;The Tavern Watch Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://hauntedtable.games&#34;&gt;Triangle Agency&lt;/a&gt;, is up now. I thought it was a lot of fun, although trying to keep the spotlight going for six people can be a real task. I also thought on reading the adventure as written &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a pre-written one from The Vault, a book of premade mysteries that came with the Triangle Agency core book &amp;ndash; that it&amp;rsquo;s not, uh, a very good mystery. As written, &lt;em&gt;Dead Quiet&lt;/em&gt; presented a whole list of locations for players to go to, but they were so saturated in clues that led directly to the end of the mystery that there was not really a reason to visit more than one. (Essentially they only even went to two because the second one had an easy way to rack up 10 Commendations from the company.) A lot of the contents of The Vault are like that, so if I run TA again, I&amp;rsquo;m definitely going to be trying to write something of my own.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I have another actual play next month for the same podcast in which I&amp;rsquo;ll be running &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonofoak/legend-in-the-mist-rpg&#34;&gt;Legend in the Mist&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s playtest materials. Should be fun; expect that to be out sometime in May, most likely.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Also my actual job has just been kind of going at breakneck speed? I&amp;rsquo;ve been pulled back and forth between two major projects, with a third looming in the wings to occupy any downtime I might have, which &amp;ndash; well, look at the timestamps on previous posts, and maybe the explanation for why my post count in March is 1 might make sense. Heh.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway: all that to say I am alive and well and keeping myself busy. Maybe I should do some devlog posts here once that game project starts being interesting to look at? Not sure if it&amp;rsquo;ll be here or somewhere else, but given how much I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed keeping everything sequested in Obsidian, it might just be here in a subfolder. Something to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
