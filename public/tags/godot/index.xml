      <description>&lt;p&gt;Opened &lt;a href=&#34;https://godotengine.org/&#34;&gt;Godot&lt;/a&gt; today and discovered it had been so long since I used it that my skills had pretty much atrophied away to nothing (in fact, I think it&amp;rsquo;s had a full version update &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;d never touched Godot 4!). Luckily, I still had one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.heartgamedev.com/&#34;&gt;Ben Anderson&amp;rsquo;s excellent Godot courses&lt;/a&gt; and it&amp;rsquo;d been updated to Godot 4, so I started over from scratch. Trying something this time that I usually don&amp;rsquo;t do for video lectures and besides coding along, I&amp;rsquo;m taking notes &amp;ndash; besides giving me yet another reason to use Obsidian, I thought it might be a nice way to actually remember some things in a more general sense.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
