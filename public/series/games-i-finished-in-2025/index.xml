This is, apparently, the Horse Lobby.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you play a game, and maybe that game is fun for a while, but when you&amp;rsquo;re done, nothing really sticks with you. You bring nothing to the table, you take nothing away, and you&amp;rsquo;re finished with it, done and dusted. I find this to be a pretty common experience with AAA games these days, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://notes.awaymessage.club/ob/posts/attachments/red%20and%20the%20transistor.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Picture of Red, the protagonist of Transistor, embracing the titular weapon/macguffin, which looks like nothing so much as a teal greatsword crossed with an SD card&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided at some point (probably after surveying &lt;a href=&#34;https://steamcommunity.com/id/stoppableforce&#34;&gt;my enormous Steam backlog&lt;/a&gt;) that I was going to start keeping track of games when I finish them, so that I remember to talk about them. Anyway, the first game of the year finished in 2025 was Supergiant Games&amp;rsquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/&#34;&gt;Transistor&lt;/a&gt;. I actually own Transistor twice; once on the PS3, which I bought, and once on Steam, where my friend Maxine was kind enough to gift it to me for Christmas and thus remind me that I never really got too far into it. On the PS3, I both found the text size on screen infuriatingly small, and also found the combat system just &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too hard for some reason, so I abandoned it not far into the game &amp;ndash; which is a problem, because there is such a good game under the surface here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
