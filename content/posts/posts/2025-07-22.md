In attempting to run [Hex Kit](https://cone.itch.io/hex-kit) on [my current desktop Linux distro](https://nobaraproject.org/), I found that the native Linux version -- unfortunately -- no longer runs -- or rather, it runs, but then crashes immediately once it tries to draw the contents of the application windows.

`[69232:0722/012218.684735:FATAL:gpu_data_manager_impl_private.cc(894)] The display compositor is frequently crashing. Goodbye.`

My gut feeling is this is an incompatibility with Wayland -- Hex Kit hasn't been updated in a couple of years and Wayland has seen pretty decent adoption since then. So I tried running it under [Lutris](https://lutris.net/) and found that it would run, but also very poorly, and the contents of all windows were just blank. Bars, but no windows. So close.

So I went through trying different compatibility settings.  I got close by telling Wine to emulate Windows 8; it drew the contents of the windows, but the bars at the tops of the windows disappeared -- they could be clicked on, however, and would throw every clickable thing in the window off by about 32 pixels down. Usable, but not really ideal. Amusingly I found that in pretending to be Windows XP that Hex Kit would still run -- but with the blank windows again!

in the end, what really worked was using setting the Wine version to Proton-GE (latest version) and telling Wine to emulate, and I cannot believe I am typing this, *Windows Vista*. That gets you a well-drawn and mostly usable version of Hex Kit running on Linux desktops again. (It's not perfect: the "Generate" option seems to just open a blank window, but "Generate Custom" works just fine.)
