Opened [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) today and discovered it had been so long since I used it that my skills had pretty much atrophied away to nothing (in fact, I think it's had a full version update -- I'd never touched Godot 4!). Luckily, I still had one of [Ben Anderson's excellent Godot courses](https://www.heartgamedev.com/) and it'd been updated to Godot 4, so I started over from scratch. Trying something this time that I usually don't do for video lectures and besides coding along, I'm taking notes -- besides giving me yet another reason to use Obsidian, I thought it might be a nice way to actually remember some things in a more general sense.

I'm getting very, very close to having my Obsidian-to-Github-Pages pipeline finished. I finally figured out what I was doing wrong today as far as not getting Jekyll to build notes into posts, but right now I can't figure out how to get static URLs working (to link to images, like back on [2024-12-11](/2024-12-11.md)). I think I just need to twiddle Enveloppe's settings a bit -- but right now Jekyll isn't pushing the file out where I expect it to be, either.

**Update:** In the end, the solution turned out to be dumping Jekyll entirely -- it's overkill for what I wanted! Instead, I followed [this great tutorial by Nicole van der Hoeven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s6DT1yN4dw) on how to build an Obsidian vault with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) -- although my Quartz install, rather than being the entire vault, is just symlinked to the subfolder in my vault that stores my daily notes. Now I can easily post these onto the web.

In fact, I took this one step further and set up an [Obsidian shell command](https://github.com/Taitava/obsidian-shellcommands) to run the sync command from Obsidian. Now I don't even have to leave Obsidian!
