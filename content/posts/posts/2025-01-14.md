This past weekend was one of my favorite recurring events, now going on three years in a row: several of my college friends and I rent out an AirBNB and spend the weekend making food together, eating, drinking, and playing card, board and video games. It's just like a weekend-long taste of dorm life again, except we've all moved from takeout to chili cookoffs and cheap beer to a bar full of nice bourbons and whiskeys. It's always a good time catching up with people; as a bonus this time we managed to get a couple of folks we hadn't talked with in maybe 17 years to join us as well. It felt just like old times again. We're all the same, just older and greyer.

Then this morning I managed to briefly break [Away Message Club][1] by attempting to apply updates; it turns out that after version 4.2.12, the amount of assets that need to be precompiled as part of each update now takes more memory to precompile than the server actually needs to run Mastodon. I now need to remember to add a swapfile temporarily just for the duration of the update process. We got there eventually, but we're now at version 4.3.2.
