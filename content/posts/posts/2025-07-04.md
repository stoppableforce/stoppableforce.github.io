Still finishing off demos from Steam Next Fest. I may have overestimated my free time. Heck, two of the demos expired before I could play them; I got a “no licenses found” error on Steam, making them unplayable.

Anyway. Let’s get to it.

## WIZman’s World Re;try

Sometimes you just need a good old-fashioned JRPG where you shove monster souls into fairies that belonged to your adoptive mom in order to find out why the city you’re in is surrounded by collapsing dungeons. It’s a neat story, if nothing earth shattering, and the pixel art and monster fusion are a treat for me. I’ll probably get it when it’s on sale sometime.

## Danchi Days

A cute pixelated adventure game about a kid reviving the summer festival at her apartment complex so that she can fix her largely silent grandma’s Alzheimer’s.

Oh boy.

It looks cute. I have a feeling this one’s gonna be a major gut punch though. Might snag it anyway, because I guess *Expedition 33* has proven I’m into that sort of thing.

## Lock and Key: A Magical Girl Mystery

Two retired magical girls - a consulting detective and her wife, Chicago’s most notorious cat burglar - try to solve a series of locked-room murders while also training a new generation magical girl, all while dealing with being in the waning years of having their powers. This visual novel demo was just tantalizing enough that I’m gonna have to get this one for sure.
