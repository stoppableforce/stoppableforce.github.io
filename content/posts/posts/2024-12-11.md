Slowly getting used to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). I've got livesyncing working across multiple machines without actually paying for it (using the [obsidian-livesync](https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync) community plugin and a CouchDB database on my NAS at home), and I think my next goal is to be able to publish this folder of daily notes as a blog.

Need to find out if there's a way to use YAML front matter to add a title to these notes without changing their filename, or if I'm just leaving it as is. Maybe titles are overrated? Tags would still be nice, if I intend to publish these as a blog.

Last week my WoW guild finished the heroic tier of the first raid of The War Within:

![My World of Warcraft raid guild, gathered around a defeated Queen Ansurek](/ob/posts/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241211165034.png)

It was an unusual experience for me because it's the first tier my primary role has been healing, and I primarily have played in the past as a tank (where the metric is "did you die?") or as a DPS (where you can figure out how well you're doing with *math*.)
