New year, new really nerdy way to apply Obsidian. Ever since I bought [I Was a Teenage Exocolonist][1] in November I've been really obsessed with exploring every little corner of this beautiful little narrative deckbuilding RPG. I recently decided I wanted to get 100% completion of the game, but doing that requires two things that take some extensive tracking: getting every ending at least once (there are 29), and getting every card at least once (there are.... tons). Obviously I can just make checklists in Obsidian, but then I figured out I could use [Dataview][2] to query over those files as well, and show myself a nice table of my progress.

Also, I re-upped my Crunchyroll sub but man am I horribly out of date on what's good in anime. Someone please tell me some good anime to watch (either on [Bluesky][3] or [Mastodon][4]).
