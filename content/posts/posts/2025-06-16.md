Hypothetically, if I did everything correctly, this site should now be running off [Hugo][1]. I was never *super* happy with the way Quartz required me to maintain my own front page, since it really wants to throw your entire vault onto a website instead of just a subset of it, which required me to do wonky stuff with symlinks and directory junctions and... anyway, after [I broke my own Quartz install](/2025-06-12.md) a few days ago, I decided to just say fuck it, let's try something else. Now I've got an Obsidian vault with a specific subfolder that, thanks to a community plugin, I can spit into a Hugo install whenever I like.

And here we are. Reinventing the wheel yet again. But every time I have a new wheel, an older wheel looks cooler...
