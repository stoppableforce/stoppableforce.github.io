Over the course of the last year, I have slowly been taking steps to pull myself out of actively using the Google ecosystem. It's hard sometimes -- they feel almost ubiquitous -- but when Gemini came around and it became clear that active enshittification was the name of the game for the big G, I had to start finding ways to get free.

The other inspiration was just what a fucking miserable experience searching the web had become. So my first de-googlefication was stopping use of Google, and starting to instead use [Kagi](https://kagi.com/). This has been a delightful experience, and I've talked a number of folks into coming along with me (enough that I have a family plan!), as changing your browser to search somewhere else is fairly low effort.

Next was my browser. When word came out that Google was going to break ad-blockers, I first set up a [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) on my NAS, then doubled down and swapped to Firefox on my desktop and my phone. The only odd man out at this point was my laptop, because it was a Chromebook; escaping Google's ecosystem from hardware that's tied into them from the firmware up felt near-impossible (and no, Firefox in a Linux dev environment was not it).

Last week I took one of the hardest steps and finally stopped using Gmail. I set up an account with [Fastmail](https://fastmail.com) since it really has the two services I still used -- email and calendar -- and doesn't have a sketchy CEO who keeps "accidentally" supporting right-wing causes on the company social media accounts like Proton. So far it's been really satisfying, even if I'm not fully detached from Gmail yet; I'm slowly changing actual accounts over to use Fastmail, letting Fastmail pull incoming mail from Gmail, and using inbox rules to finally rid myself of a lot of detritus I've just been living with over the years.

Today I opened my Chromebook, which is my couch computer, and it had disabled my adblocker. Well, time to completely de-google this thing. With a little research, actual physical work, and help from [MrChromebox](https://mrchromebox.tech) I managed to flash my Chromebook -- an [Acer GE 516](https://www.acer.com/us-en/chromebooks/acer-chromebook-516-ge-cbg516-1h), so it's actually not a slouch as a casual-use computer -- with new firmware to allow it to boot other operating systems, and (after upgrading the SSD to 2 TB while I was in there, because I just had a 2 TB SSD lying around) installed [Nobara Linux](https://nobaraproject.org/), doing what I had previously thought impossible (or at least high effort): de-google-ifying a piece of hardware.

Yes, I'm one of those Linux on the desktop sickos. I blame the Steam Deck for showing me exactly what the capabilities of Linux on modern hardware are like.
